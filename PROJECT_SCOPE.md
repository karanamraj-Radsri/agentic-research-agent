# PROJECT SCOPE

## Project Title: Agentic Research Agent

## Project Overview
The Agentic Research Agent (ARA) is designed to assist researchers by automating literature review, data analysis, and report generation.

## Objectives
1. **Automation of Literature Review**: Enable the ARA to summarize research papers, highlight key findings, and identify trends in the literature.
2. **Data Handling**: Equip ARA with tools for data analysis, including statistical analyses and data visualizations.
3. **Report Generation**: Allow users to generate structured reports based on collected data and literature insights.

## Deliverables
- An automated literature review tool.
- Data analysis module with visualizations.
- A reporting feature to generate research summaries.
- Comprehensive user documentation.

## Constraints
- **Time**: The project must be completed within 6 months.
- **Budget**: Limited funding, requiring effective resource management.
- **Technology**: Must use open-source technologies wherever possible.

## Technical Specifications
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Flask for backend services, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
- **Database**: SQLite for storing research data and summaries.
- **Deployment**: Services should be dockerized for easy deployment.
